First i have clone the repo then i have made a new branch and make change in the md file add it and then commit it and push .
Creat a pull request at main 
then allow the pull request from new repo.

also write the pre-commit and post-commit script  
in pre-commit script we check if there is any whitespaces in the file or concole.log if the condition match it does not allow us to commit.
